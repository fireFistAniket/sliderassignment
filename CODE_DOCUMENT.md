Using the App Component in a React Application
The App component provided is a complex React component using Material UI (MUI) for styling and functionality. It features a custom-styled slider for selecting credit amounts, a switch to toggle auto top-up settings, and links to additional information. This guide will help you understand how to integrate and use this component within your React application.

Overview of the App Component
The App component is designed to manage a feature for auto top-up credits in an application, perhaps for services or products that require credits to use. It includes:

Auto Top-up Switch: A toggle switch to enable or disable the auto top-up feature.
Credits Slider: A slider that allows users to select how many credits to auto-purchase when their balance runs low.
Dynamic Texts and Links: Informational text that changes based on the toggle state and provides a link to learn more about the feature.
Confirm Button: A button to confirm the auto-purchase settings.


## Prerequisites

Before using the App component, ensure the following:

React Environment: A React project setup, typically created via Create React App or another React boilerplate.
Material UI Installation: MUI components and icons must be installed in your project. If not already installed, you can add them using npm or yarn:

```bash
  npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
```
    
## Component Integration

To use the App component in your React application, follow these steps:

Import the Component: If the App component is defined in a file named App.tsx, ensure it is correctly exported and then imported where you need to use it.

```javascript
import App from './App';
```

Render the Component: Place the App component in your application's component tree, typically in the main entry file (like main.tsx for smaller projects):


```javascript
function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <App />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Render the Component: Place the App component in your application's component tree, typically in the main entry file (like main.tsx for smaller projects):

Component Customization
You may need to customize the App component to fit the specific needs and styling of your application:

Styling: Modify the sx properties or create a custom theme using MUI's ThemeProvider to match the component's appearance with your application's design.
Functionality: Adjust handlers like handleSliderChange to implement specific logic when the user interacts with the controls.

## Understanding Component Logic
State Management: The component uses React state hooks (useState) to manage toggle states and slider values.

Event Handling: Functions like handleSliderChange manage changes to the slider, affecting both the credits value and the text displayed.
Conditional Rendering: The component renders different text and options based on the toggle state of the auto top-up feature.
## Summary

The App component is a self-contained feature for managing auto top-up settings in an application that uses credits. It showcases how to integrate MUI components with React functionality for a dynamic and interactive user experience. By following the setup and integration steps, you can effectively utilize this component within your React application. Adjust the component as necessary to align with your specific use case and application requirements.
